[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/d02eb622-335a-430a-aa60-a3b739ce53cd/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/mars-roving/deploys)

--------------------------------

## test

### Test the frontend app in [cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)
```
npm run test-browser
```
This will open the cypress GUI so you can run some tests that depend on a browser environment.

### Test `wrapper` in node:
```
npm test
```

------------------------------------

## develop
```
npm start
```

## build
```
npm run build
```

------------------------------------------

## notes

The `wrapper` uses an isomarphic fetch module, so it works in either node or browsers

We are using [pull-streams](https://pull-stream.github.io/) here, which is not a standard in node or browsers, because it is the simplest way to achieve the goals of the slideshow -- "it shouldn't synchronously load all images". Also it allows us to adjust the speed of the iteration, and it works everywhere -- node and browsers.

This is an example of my preferred testing system -- cypress for browser environment, `tape` for node.js

## https://hiring.hypercore-protocol.org/

> For this task, we ask that you write two components, the second building on the first.

> Both approaches share one component in common: a wrapper module that exports an easy-to-use interface for querying the Rover API:

> At `hiring.hypercore-protocol.org/termrover`, we've created an HTTP(S) API that lets you get images from Perseverance's "Front Left Hazard Avoidance Camera".

>  our API returns the images as both:
> * Base64-encoded strings (for embedded in img tags)
> * ASCII art (for displaying in the terminal)

## Wrapper Module

The first module should be a small wrapper around the Rover API that exposes a few methods for dealing with Rover images. There should be methods for:

* Getting all information about the latest Rover image (the `/termrover/latest` endpoint).
* Generating an iterator over all Rover images/metadata, ordered from earliest to latest (smaller indexes on the `/termrover/:index` endpoint are considered earlier). **This can be a Node.js stream, an async iterator, or a similar abstraction**, but it **shouldn't synchronously load all images**.

In both cases, the JSON response should be forwarded with minimal modifications â€” no need to extract out pieces of the response.

Once this module is tested and documented, you should do either the CLI Task, or the Frontend Task, as described below.
